{% include open_section.html nav='nav_userdoc_emails.html' selected='displaying_files' %}

	<p>
		If your form contains file upload fields, your email templates will contain lines like this:
	</p>

	{% codemirror smarty %}
{display_files format="html" files=$FILENAMES_field1 folder=$FOLDERURL_field1}
	{% endcodemirror %}

    <p>
        Here's what's going on. The <code>{display_files}</code> function handles displaying the contents of your file
        field. Version 2.1.0 of the File Upload module added the option to upload multiple files in a single form field
        so we needed a way to display the contents of a file upload field in a variety of different ways: in text format,
        HTML format, as plain filenames, filenames as links to the actual file, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
        The email patterns are preset to output the correct configuration for this method for the selected pattern,
        but here's what options exist and what they do.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>format</code>: this option governs how the file content is outputted, either: "html" or "text".
            The default value is "text" so if this attribute isn't defined, that'll be the value.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>files</code>: the list of files found in the particular field. This should always be set to the
            placeholder containing that information, e.g. <code>$FILENAMES_fieldX</code> (where "fieldX" is the field
            name of your file upload field)
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>folder</code>: this is the URL folder containing the files uploaded to this field. It should
            be set to the placeholder <code>$FOLDERURL_fieldX</code> -
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>delim</code>: whatever you want to delimit the list of items with. For HTML, you'll probably want
            <code>, </code> or <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>link</code>: this setting controls whether you want a full link outputted to the email or just the
            filename. For HTML emails this will appear as a full link that the user can click on. For text emails,
            generally email clients will know to render the URL as a clickable link but some may just output the URL
            as a non-clickable string.
        </li>
    </ul>
